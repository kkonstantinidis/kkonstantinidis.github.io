## Software Engineer, Platform at C3.ai, Inc.
Redwood City, CA | 09/2022 – Present  

I am a member of the Platform - Data team working on machine learning infrastructure problems. I research, build and optimize systems that store descriptive attributes used in machine learning. My methods can transform and fetch the data from the database with low latency. I analyze the complexity of my algorithms mathematically and experimentally and identify bottlenecks to speed them up and reduce cloud computing costs on AWS and GCP. Finally, I organize meetings with data scientists and engineers to discuss my findings, analyze efficiency and investigate optimizations to reduce computation time across multiple machines.

## Software Engineer Intern at Meta Platforms, Inc. (Facebook)
Menlo Park, CA | 05/2022 – 08/2022  

Developed multiple debugging components for machine learning feature authoring used in the data pipelines of Facebook Marketplace. The main component was a framework that categorizes errors during feature compilation, generates alerts, and assigns tasks to the appropriate team; this framework was integrated with the CI/CD. Another end product of my work was an internal UI tool to fetch and display feature values from low-latency storage after a series of transformations.

## Software Engineering Intern, Platform at C3.ai, Inc.
Redwood City, CA | 06/2021 – 08/2021  

Implemented an end-to-end framework for cluster failure prediction; the framework has two components. The first is the data pipeline which loads cluster health metrics, handles missing data, and creates a training data set. The second component is the ML pipeline which trains a model and makes predictions regarding the cluster's state as soon as new test data becomes available. Followed the process of continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD).

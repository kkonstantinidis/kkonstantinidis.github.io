## Software Engineering Intern at C3.ai
Redwood City, CA | 06/2021 – 08/2021  

- Implemented an end-to-end framework for cluster failure prediction; the framework has two components. The first one is the data pipeline which loads cluster health metrics, handles missing data and creates a training data set. The second component is the ML pipeline which trains a model and makes predictions regarding the cluster’s state as soon as new test data becomes available. Followed the process of continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD).

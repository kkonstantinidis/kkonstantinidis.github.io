## Software Engineer Intern at Meta (Facebook)
Menlo Park, CA | 05/2022 – 08/2022  

Developed multiple debugging tools for machine learning feature authoring used in the data pipelines of Facebook Marketplace. The main component was a framework that categorizes errors during feature compilation, generates alerts, and assigns tasks to the appropriate team; this framework was integrated with the CI/CD. Another end product of my work was an internal UI tool to fetch and display feature values from low-latency storage after a series of transformations.

## Software Engineer Intern at C3.ai
Redwood City, CA | 06/2021 – 08/2021  

Implemented an end-to-end framework for cluster failure prediction; the framework has two components. The first is the data pipeline which loads cluster health metrics, handles missing data, and creates a training data set. The second component is the ML pipeline which trains a model and makes predictions regarding the cluster's state as soon as new test data becomes available. Followed the process of continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD).

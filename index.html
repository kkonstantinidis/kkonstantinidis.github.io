<h2>About me</h2>
Hello! I am Konstantinos Konstantinidis, but I prefer to go by Kostas. I am working towards my doctorate degree at the <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~adityar" target="_blank">Aditya Ramamoorthy</a>. My current research involves robust machine learning, speeding up time-intensive distributed computations, and alleviating the effects of slow computing devices on distributed setups. Currently, I am a Software Engineer at C3 AI, and specifically, I have been working on the Platform - Data team since September 2022. During Summer 2022, I interned as a Software Engineer at Meta (Facebook) on the App Commerce ML Feature Foundation team implementing a debugging framework for machine learning feature authoring. I have also worked as a Software Engineer Intern at C3 AI, developing the data and ML pipelines for cluster failure prediction. In my free time, I have volunteered as a tutor helping 3rd-grade students in Iowa with math.

<p>I received my Electrical and Computer Engineering Diploma from the <a href="https://www.ece.tuc.gr/index.php?id=4481" target="_blank">Technical University of Crete</a> in Chania, Greece, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.telecom.tuc.gr/~karystinos/" target="_blank">George Karystinos</a>. My undergraduate thesis involved research on fast synchronization of FSK signals.
